## Project Proposal

For my Games Engines Project I plan to make an audio visualizer in the form of a tunnel where there are cuboid going around the inside of
the tunnel which grow and shrink according to the audio. The direction of the tunnel will be procedurally generated as well as the colours
of the different bars. The camera will move throught this tunnel as the it changes direction and the song is played.

It will have a similar concept to this project:
[Mesh Vertices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXm9OmzRe2o&list=PL1n0B6z4e_E5qaYwUOlJ63XI2OR9ty7Bs).

where the camera moves through a procedually generated tunnel but will differ in that it will have an audio visualiser that controls the 
movement of objects inside the tunnel around the camera as it moves as well as differeing colours of these objects.

There are many Tutorials of audio visualisation in available for as it is a somewhat popular project Unity that I will use to help me
learn the basics . There is Unity documentation
available on this subject using [AudioSource.GetSpectrumData](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AudioSource.GetSpectrumData.html).
This allows you to grab the audio spectrym data on each update. You can use this data to get teh audio info (volume at each pitch).
